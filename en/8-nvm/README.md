## Overview

The Neo Virtual Machine (NeoVM) is a lightweight, general-purpose virtual machine that executes Neo smart contracts. In Neo N3, NeoVM has been significantly optimized for better performance, security, and developer experience.

## Key Features in Neo N3

- **Stack-based architecture** - Efficient execution model
- **Deterministic execution** - Same input always produces same output
- **Sandboxed environment** - Isolated from the host system
- **Rich instruction set** - Over 200 opcodes for various operations
- **Interoperability services** - Access to blockchain data and native contracts
