## NEO Tutorial

NEO Tutorial is designed as an onboarding tool for developers or other individuals that wish to become more familiar with the internal workings of NEO. The included tutorials will demonstrate the underlying technology used by NEO, such as information on how addresses are generated, how blocks are created and validated, and how the dBFT 2.0 consensus mechanism operates.

This tutorial has been updated for **Neo N3** (Neo 3.x), the current version of the Neo MainNet launched in 2021. Neo N3 represents a complete architectural redesign with significant improvements including native contracts, enhanced virtual machine, and improved developer experience.
